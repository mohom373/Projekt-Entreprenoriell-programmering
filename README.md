Studify is an app that helps you focus on your studies while also helping your friends get motivated for their studies as well. 

The main feature of the app is the use of the widely known Pomodoro study technique. The idea is that you (the user) set a timer between 15 
and 90 minutes to decide how long you want to study. When the timer starts a notification gets sent to specific friends that
you have chosen, to let them know that you've started a studying session. The friend can then either join and both get a shared timer 
or the notification can function as a way to tell the friend that you don't wish to be disturbed right now.
